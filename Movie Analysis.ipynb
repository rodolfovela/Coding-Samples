The average gross earning of sports movies represents 66% more of their original budget!

The other movie genres only generates $1.04 per dollar spent, only 4% of their initial budget.\n",

    "It is a trend and people are talking about them. Sports movies are becoming more and more popular and are part of the American society and culture. As Bonnet(2017) said, \"Nowadays, the belief in sports’ social role is still lasting: it is thought to bolster the teaching of and respect for values which are essential to Americanness, such as competitiveness, equal opportunities, or social mobility.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Firestein (2007) defined: \"Sports are part of the very fabric of American life, discourse, and lexicon [...]. The centrality of sports in American life is amply reflected in contemporary American cinema, (with) films featuring virtually every major sport, from football, basketball, baseball, and hockey, to boxing, horse racing, and even surfing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These explain exactly why sports movies have higher scores, both at the IMDB website and User Ratings. When we look at the numbers, sports movie IMDB scores average 6.94 (out of 10) while the average of all movies is only 6.45. Users also evaluate sports movie better in average, rating 7.07, when the average of all movies is 6.41. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only that. The numbers also confirm the preference for real-life stories, as the sports movies based on biographies have higher IMDB Score and User Ratings than the other sub-genres of sports and the average of all movies! For example the movie \"42\", a Biography/Sport movie released in 2013, in the US. The movie is about baseball player Jackie Robinson, who was the first black athlete to play in Major League Baseball in the modern era (late 19th and early 20th centuries). This by itself brings a lot of social themes to debate, especially in context that we are still battling racial issues in the 21st century, more than 70 years later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This movie has a rating of 7.5, both at IMDB and User Ratings, comparing to 6.94 (Sports IMDB average) and 7.07(User Rating Sports average). \n",
